Data Viz using p5js

Simple visualization of two hours worth of GPS data collected while traveling down I-75 in Georgia.  Data were collected on a Raspberry PI connected to an ADAFruit GPS breakout board.  Plane tracks were captured with a USB SDR dongle plugged into the same Raspberry Pi, running dump1090 software.  

ADSB data here have been reduced to one minute summaries to keep the volume under control.
